### I wasn't sure what content fill this website with so the About page is going to be a list of things I like, listed in the order I thought of them. 

## Things I Like: 
1. **Seasonally Appropriate Poetry**
>I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees.

This is from Pablo Neruda's *Every Day You Play* and was not originally written in English.
2. **My Cats Who Are Named After Cheeses And Herbs**

3. **The Wikipedia Page for Chemical Compounds With Unusual Names**

4. **Using Italics To Indicate Internal Monologue**

*Five,* I'm thinking to myself as I write this. *Five seems like a good number of things to have in a list.*
5. **Finding The Number Of Times The Names Of People I Know Are In Pi And Then Putting That Into A Table**
